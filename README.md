Disclaimer
---
Progress was developed within 24 hours by a front-end developer. My goal for this application was making something viable within 24 hours and keeping it fun. Keeping it fun means no hardcore back-end development for me so that's why the admin screen isn't password protected. Also the MySQL queries are pretty straight forward and I did my best to avoid SQL injections but as I mentioned before I'm a real front-end developer and I didn't spent much time on back-end security. That's the reason why I can't be held responsible for any damage or data loss that may occur by using this application. If you are a real back-end developer and like to improve my code please go ahead and fork my repo. 

Todo
---
- Make the application look good on big television screens.
